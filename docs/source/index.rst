QUEASARS - Quantum Evolving Ansatz Variational Solver
=====================================================

QUEASARS is an open-source, qiskit-based, python package implementing quantum variational eigensolvers which use evolutionary algorithms to find a good ansatz during the optimization process, like `E-VQE <https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.09694>`_, `MoG-VQE <https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.04424>`_ or `QNEAT <https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06981>`_.
