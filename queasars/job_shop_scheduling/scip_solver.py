    Encoding class used to encode a JobShopSchedulingProblemInstance as a pyscipopt SCIP solver model.
    Needs queasars to be installed with the pyscipopt extra: pip install queasars[pyscipopt].
    It also needs SCIP to be installed in the version 8.*. In some cases, this
    should happen automatically with the pip install, others might need a manual installation.
    For details see https://github.com/scipopt/PySCIPOpt/blob/master/INSTALL.md .
    A manual installation of scip can for instance be done with conda:
    ``conda install conda-forge::scip``
